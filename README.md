# Failure_ontology
An interpretation ontology covering several sources of failures in automated planning and also during the execution phases is introduced with the purpose of working the planning more informed and the execution prepared for recovery. The proposed failure interpretation ontological module covers: 1) geometric failures, that may appear when e.g. the robot can not reach to grasp/place an object, there is no free-collision path or there is no feasible Inverse Kinematic (IK) solution. 2) hardware related failures that may appear when e.g. the robot in a real environment requires to be re-calibrated (gripper or arm), or it is sent to a non-reachable configuration. 3) software agent related failures, that may appear when e.g. the robot has software components that fail like when an algorithm is not able to extract the proper features.
